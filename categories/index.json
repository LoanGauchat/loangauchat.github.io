[{"content":"TimeSeries are a sequence of observations over a certain period.\nInsight gainable from time series: How a variable changes over time or how it depends on the change in the value of other variable(s).\nTerms:\n  Univariate time series consists of the values taken by a single variable at periodic time instance over a period.\n  Before working with time series make sure that :\n The time series is equally spaced There are no redundant values or gaps in it.     Preprocessing:  1.1 Dropping or replacing values.\nWhen preprocessing no null values are allowed so the continuity is not broken. When null values are encountered they can be replaced or drop. Replacement is generally preferred, 0, the average, preceding or succeeding values are possible replacement. In this case the last few values seem to be NULL and therefore dropping them will not affect the continuity.\nModeling:  2.1 Timeseries has 4 components:\n Level: The mean value around which the series varies Trend: It is the increasing or decreasing behavior of a variable with time Seasonality: The cyclic behavior of time time series. Noise: The error in the observations added due to environmental factors  2.2 Techniques:\nA list of four techniques to capture those components:\n Na√Øve Methods Auto Regression ARIMA Model Exponential Smoothing LSTM  ","description":"Building a scripts that recognize mushrooms","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":[""],"title":"TimeSeries","uri":"http://loangauchat.github.io/posts/timeseries/"},{"content":"In this project, The objective is to build a script that can identify a mushroom and tell us if it is edible, unedible or poisonous.\nFirst data needs to be gathered. To do so the website http://www.mushroom.world will be used as it contains an extensive database of mushrooms and their characteristics. As the database is not downloadable the website will be scraped.\n1st Step: Get the data\nTo scrap the website the python librairy Beautifulsoup will be used.\n","description":"Building a scripts that recognize mushrooms","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":[""],"title":"Mushcognition","uri":"http://loangauchat.github.io/posts/mushcognition/"}]
